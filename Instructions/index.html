  <h2 class = "greentext"> Introduction </h2>
  
  <p> This lab focuses on using interruptions to create a snake game. 
      The player should control the snake to eat as many apples as possible 
      within the time limit. For the display and countdown purpose, we use the 
      Memory Mapped device and timer tool on RARS. The exception handler used to 
      manage these exceptions is created by the student.  </p>
  
  <h2 class = "greentext"> Background</h2>
  
  
  <p> There are different kinds of snake games. To keep the complexity
      of implementing this lab manageable, this snake game is simpler
      than other ones available online. Here is one snake game, which is
      similar to this lab, to help you become familiar with the
      concept.</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>  <a href = "https://www.google.com/fbx?fbx=snake_arcade" target = "blank"> google snake game </a> </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  
  <p> The level of play --- easy, medium, and hard --- must be selected
      before the game begins. The level determines the amount of
      starting time as well as the bonus time awarded after the snake
      eats an apple. The goal of the game is for the player to control
      the snake to eat as many apples as possible. </p>
  
  <h2 class = "greentext"> Goal </h2>
  
  <p> The goal of this lab is for students to become familiar with the
    concepts of interruptions and exceptions, to gain practical experience 
    programming an exception handler in RISC-V, and to improve their programming skills.  </p>
  
  <h2 class = "greentext"> The Snake Game </h2>
  
  <p> In this snake game the player starts with an initial time budget to control the snake. 
      When the time is up or the snake hits a wall, the game is over. Whenever the player 
      leads the snake to eat an apple, they are awarded bonus time. </p>
  
  <p> The game has three levels and both the initial time budget and the
      bonus time are determined by the level selected at the start of
      the game. In this lab the following times should be used:
  
  <table style="width:100%">
    <tr>
      <th>  Game Level  </th>
      <th>  Initial Time Budget(seconds)  </th> 
      <th>  Bonus Time(seconds)  </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>120</td>
      <td>8</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>30</td>
      <td>5</td>

    </tr>
    </table>
    </p>
    
  
  <h2 class = "greentext"> Assignment </h2>
  
  <p> To create this simple snake game in RISC-V, write a program that
    reads commands from the keyboard input, handles timer interrupts and
    manages the display output.  The snake game uses two screens for
    display. One screen is displayed after the other. After the start screen, there 
    will be the game screen. 
  <ul>
    
    <li> <b>Preparation screen</b>: asks the player which level they
         would like to play: 1, 2 or 3. The screen waits until the
         number <code>1 2 or 3</code> is recognized.  There is no need
         for the player to type enter. Once your program recognizes one
         of the three numbers the game begins.  </li> 
  
    <li> <b>Game screen</b>: First, display the walls to form a
         square. The apples should appear within this square and the
         game immediately ends if the snake runs into these walls. Then
         display an apple within the square which the snake should
         eat. The coordinate of the apple is randomly generated. At the
         beginning of the game, the snake should be approximately in the center of the
         square and move to the right automatically. <b>The snake moves 
         forward by one unit every second</b>. The player can change the snake's 
         direction by entering different valid commands. The player can control 
         the snake to move up, left, down, and right by pressing the W, A, S, and D keys on the
         keyboard, respectively. Whenever the snake eats an apple, the player gets
         a point and a new apple is generated. This screen also
         displays the score the player has earned and the remaining time
         that the player has to play.  </li>
  
       </ul>
  
    <b>Note:</b> The handler should not use the user stack or the user
    stack pointer. Therefore, if calling functions inside the handler,
    you must manage a separate handler stack. Do not call functions
    inside the handler.
    
    </p>
    
    <h3 class = "greentext"> Input</h3>
    
    <p> There are two inputs to the game, both provided by interruptions:
  
         <ul>
  
     <li> <b>Keyboard input</b>: a keyboard interrupt occurs when
                the player types a character in the keyboard section of
                the <code> Keyboard and Display MMIO Simulator</code>.
                Once the typed character is one of w, a, s, and d, the snake should 
                change its moving direction accordingly.</li>
  
    
          
      <li>  <b>Timer input</b>: The other input is from the timer
        tool in RISC-V. Students should program the timer so that an
        interrupt is generated every second so that the time displayed 
        can be updated and the snake can move forward by one unit every second. </li> 
       </ul>
  
  
       Repetition of the positions of the apple throughout the game is permissible as long as the random-number
    generator is working correctly.  </p>

       <h2 class = "greentext"> More Details About This Game</h2>
  
       <h3 class = "greentext"> Square </h3> <p>The square has 11 rows
       and 21 columns(including the rows and columns for the walls).
       The numbers of the rows and the columns are not the same to
       account for the different horizontal and vertical gaps between
       characters on the screen. The goal it to produce a window that
       appears approximately square for the player. See this <a
       href="#EXECUTION">Example Execution</a>).  Given that the indices
       of the rows and columns start at 0, the walls are displayed in
       row 0, row 10, column 0, and column 20. The snake moves in rows
       1-9 and columns 1-19. The character <code>#</code> is used to
       represent a brick on the wall. Once the walls are displayed they
       never change.</p>
  
       <h3 class = "greentext"> Apple </h3>
       
       <p>To place an apple inside the square generate two random
         numbers: one for row and another for column(You should invoke the random functions twice to 
         get these two random numbers). These numbers
         must be within the range of the area where the snake can
         move. The character <code>a</code> represents an apple. Once
         the current apple is eaten by the snake, a new apple should be
         generated.</p>
        
       <h3 class = "greentext"> Snake </h3>
       
       
        <p>A single character <code>@</code> represents the head of the
          snake and three <code>*</code> characters represent the body
          of the snake. In the beginning, the snake is approximately in
          the center of the square, and it moves to the right
          automatically as soon as the game starts(You can refer to the
          <a href="#EXECUTION">Example Execution</a>). <b>The snake should 
          move forward by one unit every second</b>. The player can
          control the snake to move up, left, down, and right by
          pressing the <tt>w</tt>, <tt>a</tt>, <tt>s</tt>,
          <tt>d</tt>. The characters <tt>W</tt> , <tt>A</tt> ,
          <tt>S</tt> , <tt>D</tt> are not accepted as valid commands to
          the game. If the player doesn't give any commands, the snake
          keeps moving in the same direction until it hits a wall.  When
          the snake eats an apple, the player gets one point and bonus
          time. <b>To make this lab simpler, the size of the snake does not
          increase</b>. If the snake hits a wall, the game ends. In this
          game, we ignore the situation when the snake hits its own
          body. Thus, the player should avoid this situation as best as
          they can.</p>
  
          <h3 class = "greentext"> Bonus Time Behavior </h3>
          <p>Adding the bonus time to the remaining time is a bit tricky. Suppose the level of the current game is level 2(bonus time is 5s), 
            the snake is about to eat an apple next second, and the remaining time is now 20s. When the snake eats an apple, 
            it will have spent 1s moving to the position of the apple. As a result, the new remaining time should be 20 - 1 + 5 = 24 seconds.
          </p>
  
  
          <h3 class = "greentext"> The End of The Game </h3>
  
          <p>When the game ends, the snake should stop moving, and the
          countdown should stop.</p>
  
  
  <h2 class="greentext">Interrupts</h2>
  <h3 class="greentext">Cause and Status Register</h3>
  
    <p>This lab uses external interrupts from hardware. The role of four CSRs (Control 
      and Status Registers) are important for the use of interrupts:</p>
    <img src="images/causeReg.png" class="right">
    <ul>
      <li><code>ustatus</code> (User Status Register, <code>CSR#0</code>) is a 32-bit 
        register that controls and manages user-level interrupts in the hardware thread 
        (<i>hart</i>). To enable user-level interrupts set the 0th bit of this register 
        to 1.</li>
      <li><code>uie</code> (User-Interrupt Enable Register, <code>CSR#4</code>) is a 32-bit 
        register that controls the types of interrupts that are enabled using a bitmask. 
        Bits 4 and 8 are relevant for this lab. The 4th enables user-level timer interrupts. 
        The 8th bit enables user-level external interrupts. These bits must be set to 1 to 
        enable interrupts from the timer and the keyboard.</li>
      <li><code>utvec</code> (User Trap-Vector Base-Address Register, <code>CSR#5</code>) 
        is a 32-bit register that controls where interrupts are handled. The register 
        holds the address of the interrupt handler that should be called when an interrupt 
        or exception occurs.</li>
      <li><code>ucause</code> (User Trap Cause Register, <code>CSR#66</code>) is a 32-bit 
        register that identifiies which type of interrupt is being handled. After an exception or 
        an interrupt, this register holds the interrupt/exception code to help identify 
        its cause. An exception code is stored in the first 31 bits of ucause and the
        last bit indicates whether or not it was an interrupt or an exception. To 
        check what type of exception/interrupt occurred refer to the table. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>These CSRs can be set by using the CSR instructions. For example, to enable 
      user-level interrupts in <code>ustatus</code> use "CSR Read/Write Immediate" 
      instruction: <code>csrrwi zero, 0, 0x1</code>. Or use pseudo-instructions to read 
      and write to the CSR registers. For example:</p>
    <code> <br />
      csrr    t0, 4 &nbsp # read from CSR#4 to t0 <br />
      csrw    t0, 6 &nbsp # write whats in t0 to CSR#6 <br />
      csrwi   0, 0x4 # write 0x4 to CSR#0 <br />
    </code> <br />
    
    <p>Once an interrupt is raised it must be handled in the interrupt
      handler created in this assignment. An interrupt handler is
      analogous to a normal function but there are some key
      differences. An interrupt can occur at any time, therefore the
      handler must guarantee that all registers are restored to their
      original values after the handler finishes. Thus, the handler must
      save any register that it uses (not just the <code>s</code>
      registers) and the handler must restore the original values to
      these registers before returning. Also, the instruction
      <code>uret</code> must be used to leave the interrupt handler
      instead of the <code>jr ra</code> instruction that is used to
      return from a normal function. Again, a student should not call functions exterior to the handler if they are using the user stack point.</p> 
    
  <h3 class="greentext">Keyboard & Display</h3>
    <p>Use the <code>Keyboard and Display MMIO Simulator</code>, available under the 
      "Tools" menu in RARS, to interact with the simulator. Display the 
      simulator in the display section, and input commands in the keyboard 
      section. Don't forget to click "Connect To Program" after assembling the program 
      and before running it.</p>
    <p>Generally, devices have two registers associated with them, a control, and a data 
      register. The control register relays information about the device's state, and 
      the data register relays data to or from a device. A description of the control 
      and data registers for the keyboard and display can be found in the 
      <a href="#MMIO">Memory-Mapped IO</a> section.</p>
    <p>A separate keyboard interrupt occurs for every key pressed when the keyboard 
      interrupts are enabled. Therefore, the user program receives one character at 
      a time. 
  <h3 class="greentext">Timer</h3>
    <p>In RISC-V, timing functionality is managed by the timing hardware thread 
     , maintaining the time asynchronously and allowing the program to raise 
      an interrupt at a specific time. To do this the core keeps track of the time in 
      the 64-bit register <code>time</code> which holds the current time (in milliseconds) 
      since the program started. To generate a timer interrupt at a specified time, 
      the value in the register <code>timecmp</code> must be set. Each time the timecmp
       register is used, the student must reset the timecmp register with the new time 
       each time . A description of the 
      <code>time</code> and <code>timecmp</code> registers can be found in the 
      <a href="#MMIO">Memory-Mapped IO</a> section. To simulate RISC-V timing functionality 
      use the <code>Timer Tool</code> under the "Tools" menu in RARS. Don't forget 
      to click "Connect To Program" and "Play" after assembling the program and before 
      running it each time you run the program.</p> 
  
  <h2 class="greentext" style="clear:both"><a name="MMIO"></a>Memory-Mapped IO</h2>
  
  <p>Memory-mapped IO allows interaction with external devices through
      an interface pretending to be system memory. This mapping allows
      the processor to communicate with these devices using the
      load-word and store-word instructions. Here are the memory
      mappings and descriptions of important I/O registers for this
      lab:</p>

    <h2 class="greentext"><a name="RANDOM"></a>Random Number Generation</h2>
    
    <p>A solution to this lab must generate random numbers to determine
      the coordinate of the apple </p>
    
    <p>Implement a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG).  An LCG is a
      simple pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) algorithm defined as
      the recurrence relation:</p>
    
    <p><code>X<sub>i</sub> = ( aX<sub>i-1</sub> + c ) % m</code></p>
    
    <p>Where <code>X<sub>0</sub></code>, <code>a</code>, <code>c</code>,
      and <code>m</code> are constants. <code>X<sub>0</sub></code> is
      the seed value, <code>a</code> is the multiplier, <code>c</code>
      is the increment, and <code>m</code> is the modulus.</p>
    
    <p>The first randomly generated number is
    <code>X<sub>1</sub></code>, the second is
    <code>X<sub>2</sub></code>, and so on.</p>
    
    <p>With a PRNG, the sequence of generated numbers is always the 
      same for the same values of <code>X<sub>0</sub></code>, <code>a</code>, 
    <code>c</code>, <code>m</code>. This consistency will be important for debugging the solution to this lab.
      <a target = "_blank" href="https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/linear">Here</a> is a useful tool 
      for that generates a random sequence of numbers based on values of 
      <code>X<sub>0</sub></code>, <code>a</code>, <code>c</code>, <code>m</code> that 
      can be used to test the program. To learn more about linear 
      congruential generators, view

      this page</a>.</p>
    
      
  <h2 class="greentext"><a name="CONSTRAINTS"></a>Constraints</h2>
  
      <p> Reading or printing syscalls cannot be used in this
          program. Instead, the program must use the interrupt/poll
          system to interact with the keyboard and the display.</p>
    
    <img src="images/exceptions.png" class="right" height="400" width="500">
    
      <p> When executing RARS with your own handler, runtime errors
          won't be shown in RARS as usual. Thus, a section of the
          handler that prints the line where an error occurred and the
          error code is provided. Use the table to the right to identify
          the error.</p>
  
      <p> Make sure the handler does not call any functions.
        This ensures proper grading through the scripts and makes it easier to debug the code.
      </p>
    
  
  
  
      
    <h3 class="greentext"><a name="FOREVER"></a>Loops and Flags</h3>
    
    <p> There are two phases in the execution of the game: reading the
        level of the game; and playing the game. Each of these phases
        can execute in a loop that changes the state of the display when
        there is an interruption caused either by the input of a command
        or by a timer. A possible design would be  to reprint the 
        display for every iteration of the loop. However, such a design
        could produce a flickering in the screen in certain types of
        monitors. Therefore a better design is to have flags that
        indicate when an action must be taken in the loop. For instance,
        the display only needs to be reprinted when its content has
        changed. Therefore the loop can simply check on specific flags
        and only take action when action is needed.  Flags are variables
        that can store either 0 or 1. You can use flags to determine
        what should happen on the next iteration of the loop. By using
        different flags for the separate tasks of the program, you can
        ensure that you only execute tasks when needed.</p>
  
    <p> The exit conditions for the loops are as follows.  The
      game-level screen loop exits once a valid input is received.  The
      typing-screen loop exits once the timer has run down to zero
      seconds or the snake hits a wall. At that point you can simply end the game by returning
      from the <code>snakeGame</code> function(after you have restored all the necessary registers).  </p>
    
      <p>Here is an example of how you can use a flag to determine when
        a program prints its output:</p> <ul> <li>Have a variable stored
        in memory (<code>changed</code>) that contains the value:</li>
        <ul>
  
    <li>  <code>0</code>, if the output <b>has not</b> changed since
               it was last printed and thus doesn't need to be printed. </li>
  
    </li> <li><code>1</code>, if the output <b>has</b> changed
                since it was last printed and thus should be
                printed.</li>
  
      </ul> <li>Implement the control flow shown below
        in the loop of the program. The idea behind this control flow is
        to only print when there has been a change to the output.</li>
        <img src="images/foreverLoop.png" height="264" width="300"/>
      </ul>
  
      <p>Using flags in the loop also separates the code into
        tasks making it easier to understand and debug.
      </p>
      <b>Note:</b> You don't have to follow this. You can come up with 
      your own methods as long as your game runs properly.
  
  
  
  
  
      <h3 class="greentext"><a name="GLOBAL"></a>Global Variables</h3>
      
      <p>The following lines appear in the <code>.data</code> section of 
      <code>common.s</code>:</p>
      
      <img src="images/CommonVariables.png" width="178" height="80"/> 
      
      <p>This is similar to defining four global variables. These
        variables are used in the linear congruential generator and
        should contain the values <code>X<sub>i</sub></code>,
        <code>a</code>, <code>c</code>, and <code>m</code>
        respectively. These variables <b> must be used</b> in the
        <code>random</code> function so that the solution works with
        grading scripts. For testing, initialize the first three values
        to any value, but keep <code>mVar</code> as 9.</p>
      
        <p> You may add any other global variables that could be used to
        help run your program.</p>
    
    <h3 class="greentext">Saving Registers in the Interrupt Handler</h3>
      <p>When an interrupt is raised, the program is paused and execution is transferred to 
        the interrupt handler. To ensure that the program can safely resume execution after 
        returning from the handler, the registers used by the handler must be saved upon 
        entering the interrupt handler and restored before returning. The registers cannot be 
        saved using the stack pointer because the stack pointer may be corrupted. Therefore, in
        <code>common.s</code> we have allocated memory labeled <code>iTrapData</code> where 
        your handler may save registers. In <code>common.s</code> we have also placed the 
        address of <code>iTrapData</code> into the control status register #64, 
        <code>uscratch</code>. You can use <code>uscratch</code> and the CSR instruction 
        <code>csrrw</code> to save and restore all the values of registers used in the 
        handler.</p>
      <p>After returning from the handler, all registers must have the same value as when the
        program paused and <code>uscratch</code> should contain the address of the 
        <code>iTrapData</code>. The first instruction executed in the handler and the last 
        instruction executed before returning from the handler should be
        <code>csrrw 	a0, 0x040, a0</code>, where <code>a0</code> is chosen by convention. 
        Here is some sample code that saves two registers and <code>a0</code> in the 
        interrupt trap data:</p>
      <pre>
        handler:
    
        # swap a0 and uscratch
        csrrw   a0, 0x040, a0     # a0 <- Addr[iTrapData], uscratch <- PROGRAMa0 
    
        # save all used registers except a0
        sw      t0, 0(a0)         # save PROGRAMt0
        sw      s0, 4(a0)         # save PROGRAMs0
    
        # save a0
        csrr    t0, 0x040         # t0 <- PROGRAMa0     
        sw      t0, 8(a0)         # save PROGRAMa0 
    
        ... 
      </pre>
    <p><b>Non-re-entrant handler:</b> It is up to you how you manage the memory allocated for <code>iTrapData</code>. 
      If you allocate a specific address to save a given register --- for example, register <code>s0</code> is always saved in <code>Addr[iTrapData]+4</code> --- then your handler is not <i>re-entrant</i>.
       You cannot enable interruptions while you are handling an interruption because doing so could cause the first value of <code>s0</code> that you had saved to be overwritten.</p>
    
    <p><b>Re-entrant handler:</b> An elegant solution to create a re-entrant handler is to implement a stack in the memory area reserved for <code>iTrapData</code>. 
      The solution would have to handle an <i>interrupt stack pointer</i>. It would have to ensure that space is allocated in this stack for a new <i>interruption frame</i> 
      before interruptions are re-enabled. Once space is reserved in the interrupt stack to save the registers that the handler will use, then interrupts can safely be re-enabled. In this case we have a <i>re-entrant handler</i>.
    
    <p><b>It would be difficult to create a set of tests to determine if a handler is re-entrant. 
      Therefore, in this lab we do not require the implementation of a re-entrant handler. It is acceptable to keep interruptions disabled while an interruption is being processed.</b></p>

    <b>Hints:</b>
  
  <ul>
  
  
    <li> The coordinates for the snake head and for the snake body can
         be stored in a stack.  A global variable can be used to
         indicate that there has been a change to the position of the
         snake. There is no need to update the screen as long as this
         flag is 0. Every second, when the time interruption occurs, the
         position of the snake must be updated and this flag is changed
         to 1 to indicate a change in the screen. This flag can be
         checked by the infinite loop to decide if the screen needs to
         be redrawn. Once the screen is redrawn this flag should be
         changed back to 0. </li>
  
      
    <li> The following boolean expression can be used to check if the
         snake has hit a wall: <code>(row <= 0 || row >= 10 || col <= 0
         || col >= 20)</code>. </li>
  
    <li> To check if the snake eats an apple, compare the coordinates of
          the apple and the snake head. </li>
  
    <li> Consider the case when the apple happens to be generated right
         on the snake body. Think about how you will add the characters
         to the screen so that this apple is not covered by the snake
         body. </li>
    
    <li> You can arrange one or two stacks to store the coordinates of
         the snake head and of the snake body. </li>
  
    <li> In all the test cases the values for the timer and for the
         number of points are never higher than 999 </li>
